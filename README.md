1.PROBLEM STATEMENT:

SCHOOL SECURITY SYSTEM

Nowadays, parents are worried about their children because of the high rate of 
kidnapping. Moreover, parents are having long working hours, so they simply do not 
have as much time to spend for their children Moreover, they will be persuaded by 
kidnapper before they enter the school. So, it is the responsibility for the school to take 
care of their students and they also know in-time and able to send an alert message to 
their parents if the students are not at the school at school start time. This System 
ensures safety of the students by making their parents aware about the various 
important status about their students like in-time, out-time, everything about their arrival. 
By using RFID technology, it is easy track the student thus enhances the security and 
safety in selected zone. The information about student such as in time and out time 
from Bus and campus will be recorded to web based system and SMS will be 
automatically sent to their parents that the student arrived to Bus/Campus safely. SMS 
will be sent to parents whose children are absent without taking leave. The parents can 
log into system website and monitor the details of their children. The implementation of 
School Security System(SSS) via RFID to avoid crime, illegal activates by students and 
reduce worries among parents
